Our protobufs use dependencies from the
[Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/explore).

To resolve the dependencies in your editor, we recommend you get the Buf
plugins:
* for [JetBrains](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19147-buf-for-protocol-buffers)
* for [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bufbuild.vscode-buf)
